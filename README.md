# Basic Social Media App
This is a basic social media app built using Express and GraphQL on the backend and React on the frontend.

## App usage
Why?
#### Usage
Users can signup and login. They can view eveyones posts and make posts of their own. They can also view all comments and make comments of their own. They can view specific users' pages to see the posts they've made. Users can also update their accound details and/or delete their account.

## Setup
Really. Why?

## But wait....
"Why is the _______ not like an actual _______?"  
Since this application was made only to learn a bunch of stuff, a lot of critical features would be missing.
For example there is no notifications system and no concept of friends/followers.
There is also pagination only for the home page, but not for the users page.
Other odd design choices, like in the GraphQL schema, are explained as comments in those files.
