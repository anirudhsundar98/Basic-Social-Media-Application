/**
 * This schema does not have some features that a complete app would have.
 * For instance, Comment should have a Post field that gives information on its parent post 
 *   However this is unnecessary as the app never fetches comments alone. It always fetches posts and their comments.
 * Similarly, User could have a posts field to represent their posts.
 *   However, user posts are fetched through getPosts to avoid redundant code in the getUser query.
