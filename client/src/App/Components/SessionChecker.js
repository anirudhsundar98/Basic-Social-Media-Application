/**
 * Meant to check the session each time the user visits a new page.
 * This is to make sure that the user is forced to login again if he visits a new page after his session expires.
 * Meaningless for social media platforms as they generally have sessions that never expire too soon.
 * The fact that the cookie's expiration date in this app is one year makes it even more meaningless.
 * Implemented simply as an exercise. Component is commented out in the main app.
 * Performance can be augmented with a timeout between session checks (like once every x units of time).
 * This will also reduce the number of requests sent to the server.
